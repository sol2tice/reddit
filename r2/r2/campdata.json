The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences.", "asianpop": "\n                  $436,768\n\t\t", "type": "Residential and/or Commuting", "longitute": "11.0782299042", "description": "Serious about video games?

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences.", "asianpop": "\n                  $436,768\n\t\t", "type": "Commuting", "longitute": "11.0782299042", "description": "Learn the Basics of Filming and Editing in this Moviemaking Experience\n\nReady to make a summer blockbuster?

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott.

Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions.

The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences.", "asianpop": "\n                  $436,768\n\t\t", "type": "Commuting", "longitute": "11.0782299042", "description": "Learn How to Create all Different kinds of Animation like Professional Animators\n\nLearn how animators created some of your favorite shows and movies, like Adventure Time\u2122, ParaNorman\u2122 and Wallace and Gromit\u2122.

The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore's Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises twelve colleges that differ in character and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs.\r\nAcademically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was the birthplace of insulin and stem cell research, and was the site of the first practical electron microscope, the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of Cygnus X-1 as a black hole, and the theory of NP completeness. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual research funding of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the United States.\r\nThe Varsity Blues are the athletic teams representing the university in intercollegiate league matches, with particularly long and storied ties to gridiron football and ice hockey. The university's Hart House is an early example of the North American student centre, simultaneously serving cultural, intellectual and recreational interests within its large Gothic-revival complex.\r\nThe University of Toronto has educated two Governors General and four Prime Ministers of Canada, four foreign leaders, fourteen Justices of the Supreme Court, and has been affiliated with ten Nobel laureates.

Over the course of the program, students will participate in three main courses: Debate, Persuasive Speaking, and an elective.\n\nDebate\n\nLearn the art of verbal combat! Students will learn how to construct persuasive positions, defend against and attack each other\u2019s arguments, and cross-examine effectively. Students will debate a variety of age- and experience-appropriate topics, form teams, and pit themselves against their co-campers. Past debate topics have included: school uniforms (elementary school), pre-emptive strike policy (middle school), and the legal drinking age (high school).\n\nPersuasive Speaking\n\nThis useful activity teaches students to craft and deliver convincing speeches. Students start by performing a number of pre-written speeches in order to learn delivery, timing, and intonation. When students display comfort with delivery, they will begin to construct speeches based on their interests. Students learn to choose topics, establish captivating introductions, organize speech content, and deliver compelling conclusions! The focus is on speaking in a natural voice, with few or no notes, rather than writing an essay and merely reading it out loud, the form of \"public speaking\" taught by most teachers. All students end the week by presenting a speech in front of a large group of fellow campers.\n\nElectives\n\nIn the evenings, students will get to choose from at least two of the following four elective speaking activities:\n\nModel Congress: This event provides an introduction to diplomatic and legislative speaking. Students role-play as members of Congress. Persuasive speaking, negotiations, and compromise are all stressed in a forum that allows students to sample the most exciting part of the political process!\n\nNegotiations: You can't always get what you want... or can you? The negotiations activity stresses public speaking as a business and personal tool. Students will role-play scenarios in which their abilities to compromise and persuade are developed.\n\nReader's Theater: In this fun and popular event, students write and perform a short play (or learn and perform a play for younger students). Students create their characters, devise plot twists, write dialogue, and deliver partial practice performances followed by the whole play.\n\nImprovisational Speaking: This type of speaking requires students to think on their feet to deliver speeches with little or no preparation time. In the opening class, students are given ample time to prepare for short speeches, and over the course of the program the time to prepare will shorten as the speeches lengthen. Fun and challenging topics are chosen, often with hilarious results!\n\nPublic Speaking Institute students experience university life during their week on a college campus. Students live together in the dormitories, experience campus dining, and relax on campus with a wide array of sports and arts activities. Additionally, the camp will take one mid-week excursion to a local attraction, such as an amusement park or sports venue.

Past debate topics have included: school uniforms (elementary school), pre-emptive strike policy (middle school), and the legal drinking age (high school).\n\nPersuasive Speaking\n\nThis useful activity teaches students to craft and deliver convincing speeches. Students start by performing a number of pre-written speeches in order to learn delivery, timing, and intonation. When students display comfort with delivery, they will begin to construct speeches based on their interests. Students learn to choose topics, establish captivating introductions, organize speech content, and deliver compelling conclusions! The focus is on speaking in a natural voice, with few or no notes, rather than writing an essay and merely reading it out loud, the form of \"public speaking\" taught by most teachers. All students end the week by presenting a speech in front of a large group of fellow campers.\n\nElectives\n\nIn the evenings, students will get to choose from at least two of the following four elective speaking activities:\n\nModel Congress: This event provides an introduction to diplomatic and legislative speaking. Students role-play as members of Congress. Persuasive speaking, negotiations, and compromise are all stressed in a forum that allows students to sample the most exciting part of the political process!\n\nNegotiations: You can't always get what you want... or can you? The negotiations activity stresses public speaking as a business and personal tool. Students will role-play scenarios in which their abilities to compromise and persuade are developed.\n\nReader's Theater: In this fun and popular event, students write and perform a short play (or learn and perform a play for younger students). Students create their characters, devise plot twists, write dialogue, and deliver partial practice performances followed by the whole play.\n\nImprovisational Speaking: This type of speaking requires students to think on their feet to deliver speeches with little or no preparation time. In the opening class, students are given ample time to prepare for short speeches, and over the course of the program the time to prepare will shorten as the speeches lengthen. Fun and challenging topics are chosen, often with hilarious results!\n\nPublic Speaking Institute students experience university life during their week on a college campus. Students live together in the dormitories, experience campus dining, and relax on campus with a wide array of sports and arts activities.

This seven-day camp offers students exposure to many of the same principles that older students get at College Admission Prep Camp in a similarly relaxed and fun atmosphere. Prep Camp Excel uses a three-pronged curriculum to promote high school success, including courses in Essay Writing, PSAT Prep, and Study Skills.\n\nEssay Writing Writing competent essays is not only critical to getting good grades, but it is also one of the most important skills a student can take away from high school. Unfortunately, the kind of one-on-one instruction necessary in learning to write well is rarely available in schools. At Prep Camp Excel, students have the opportunity to work individually with experienced, first-rate teachers. Each student will bring home one of the best essays he or she has ever written, and most importantly, will have gained the knowledge of how to write more outstanding essays for the new school year!\n\nPSAT Prep and Test Taking Training The PSAT is a crucial test for college recruiting as well as for the National Merit Scholarship contest, yet most students go into the exam with little or no preparation. Excel campers will take two full PSAT exams over the course of the week. Our exclusive curriculum teaches math, grammar and vocabulary building skills, which not only prove invaluable for the PSAT but also for Math and English classes in high school. The two-year average PSAT score improvement of Prep Camp Excel students, measured by entrance and exit exams, is 16.2 points- the equivalent of 162 points on the SAT!\n\nStudy Skills Good students know that success in high school is not just about how much you know but about how you organize, display and use that knowledge. Our instructors will work with students in important areas that are often overlooked in the high school curriculum: high school planning, presentation skills, time management, and notetaking.\n\nLife On and Off Campus Planned recreational excursions allow students to experience local attractions, and on-campus evening and afternoon activities balance the academic day.

Over the course of 14 days, students participate in a morning core course and choose from a variety of specialized afternoon electives. Students showcase their work in an extraordinary final performance, which includes monologue work and ensemble short scenes.\n\nAdmission Requirements Eligible students must be entering 9th-12th grade in order to attend the High School session of the California Actors Workshop. Students must demonstrate passion for acting and theater by having taken drama classes or planning to during high school. Students are required to submit a 250 word Personal Statement that explains their interest in acting and desire to attend the program.\n\nCore Curriculum The core curriculum for the Actors Workshop is an acting class that focuses on combining creative intuition with concrete technical skills. Following Stanislavski, students learn to tap into emotional truth while exploring how mental and physical techniques can nurture unconscious inspiration. Each morning, students will practice exercises that help them vocally project, physically tell stories, and emotionally and intellectually connect to characters. Both morning acting classes and afternoon rehearsals help students understand the basic building blocks of realistic acting such as playing objectives (what the character wants), obstacles (what stands in the way), and tactics (how the character tries to get around those obstacles to accomplish her objectives).\n\nElectives Elective offerings vary each year and depend on the specialty of the acting faculty. Possible offerings include:\n\nSolo Performance: Learn to research, write, direct, and perform a one-person show.\n\nMusical Theater: Some emotions and ideas can only be expressed in song. If you have dreams of Broadway, this elective can help you sing, dance, and learn the skills you need to explore the exciting world of musical theater.\n\nStand-up Comedy: If you\u2019ve always wanted to be in front of the microphone, here\u2019s your chance. Learn comic timing, observational humor, and how to interact with an audience when you\u2019re talking directly to them.\n\nThe World is a Stage Unlike other arts camps that are situated in isolated locations, the California Actors Workshop believes that one of the most important components of training for aspiring performers is to see as much professional theater as possible. For this reason, participants visit Bay Area theaters to observe hit shows and small productions. Recently attended productions include Jersey Boys, The Lion King, Rent, and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream at the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival. Students will often participate in a post-performance Q & A with actors and directors, during which they will have the opportunity to ask about techniques, artistic direction, and the life of an artist. In the classroom, instructors specifically draw on the material viewed at visited theaters. For the California Actors Workshop, the world is not only a stage but also a classroom.\n\n\u201cDrama-Free\u201d Recreation Even though the students and faculty live and breathe passion for the theater, the High School Actors Workshop students balance acting classes with daily \u201cdrama-free\u201d recreation. Students participate in a wide array of games, sports, and arts and crafts.

It gives students the unique chance to live on a prestigious college campus, learn about college life first-hand, and prepare for significant academic opportunities with the help and guidance of experienced professionals.\n\nThe program curriculum includes three core components: SAT preparation that uses market-leading materials and instruction; personal statement writing for the college admission essay; and college counseling from an experienced staff of academic advisors.\n\nSAT Preparation: College Admission Prep Camp is an opportunity to learn the skills needed for success on the SAT, including essay writing techniques, grammar skills, advanced math and critical reading. Our experienced instructors employ the exclusive and time-tested Test Scholars SAT curriculum, which familiarizes students with all aspects of the new SAT exam. Our focus is to provide students with the test taking strategies and reasoning skills, rather than training students to rely primarily on tricks. Test Scholars students have historically scored average increases of nearly 200 points! College Admission Prep Camp is uniquely equipped to maximize SAT scores because our curriculum utilizes College Board materials. Rather than try to mimic the College Board\u2019s questions, the program purchases all exams directly from the test maker. Students receive practice workbooks and exams, and a set Test Scholars\u2019 exclusive flash cards- 800 of the most important SAT vocabulary words, plus 250 math flash cards for review of important formulas and techniques. Overall, campers receive 40 hours of supervised SAT prep. This is double what most competing mainapp_program offer and will undoubtedly ready students for this monumentally important examination.\nPersonal Statement Writing: The Personal Statement is a student\u2019s chance to show that he/she is more than a test score or grade point average. It is a significant platform for demonstrating clarity, character and unquantifiable qualifications for college admittance. To this end, College Admission Prep Camp offers every student hours of one-on-one consulting with expert writing instructors during a daily block dedicated solely to honing each student\u2019s work. From the conception of an essay topic to the final revised piece, the writing program teaches students how to write the kind of essay that will present them in the best light during the college admission process. Students learn to express the self-awareness, imagination, and curiosity that will make them attractive candidates to selective colleges. By the end of the program, each student will have written about a meaningful personal topic that is ready, or nearly ready, for submission with his or her college application.\nCollege Counseling: Even at the most prestigious private high schools the ratio of students to counselors can exceed 100:1, offering minimal individual contact and attention. College Admission Prep Camp gives each participant direct access to some of the top guidance counselors in the country. College counselors identify excellent colleges that are appropriate for each student\u2019s interests and academic background. In addition, the counselors teach students how to prepare their applications to match the expectations of college admission officers, including help with the finer points of style and phrasing. The program's counselors help students pinpoint top quality schools that are best suited to their particular needs and interests. Students leave at the end of camp with a list of potential schools that have been reviewed and discussed individually with a college counselor, advice from their counselor, and a college admission calendar that will help families avoid last minute scrambling and missed deadlines. Students also receive interview training that prepares students to present themselves in application or scholarship interviews.

It gives students the unique chance to live on a prestigious college campus, learn about college life first-hand, and prepare for significant academic opportunities with the help and guidance of experienced professionals.\n\nThe program curriculum includes three core components: SAT preparation that uses market-leading materials and instruction; personal statement writing for the college admission essay; and college counseling from an experienced staff of academic advisors.\n\nSAT Preparation: College Admission Prep Camp is an opportunity to learn the skills needed for success on the SAT, including essay writing techniques, grammar skills, advanced math and critical reading. Our experienced instructors employ the exclusive and time-tested Test Scholars SAT curriculum, which familiarizes students with all aspects of the new SAT exam. Our focus is to provide students with the test taking strategies and reasoning skills, rather than training students to rely primarily on tricks. Test Scholars students have historically scored average increases of nearly 200 points! College Admission Prep Camp is uniquely equipped to maximize SAT scores because our curriculum utilizes College Board materials. Rather than try to mimic the College Board\u2019s questions, the program purchases all exams directly from the test maker. Students receive practice workbooks and exams, and a set Test Scholars\u2019 exclusive flash cards- 800 of the most important SAT vocabulary words, plus 250 math flash cards for review of important formulas and techniques. Overall, campers receive 40 hours of supervised SAT prep. This is double what most competing mainapp_program offer and will undoubtedly ready students for this monumentally important examination.\nPersonal Statement Writing: The Personal Statement is a student\u2019s chance to show that he/she is more than a test score or grade point average. It is a significant platform for demonstrating clarity, character and unquantifiable qualifications for college admittance. To this end, College Admission Prep Camp offers every student hours of one-on-one consulting with expert writing instructors during a daily block dedicated solely to honing each student\u2019s work. From the conception of an essay topic to the final revised piece, the writing program teaches students how to write the kind of essay that will present them in the best light during the college admission process. Students learn to express the self-awareness, imagination, and curiosity that will make them attractive candidates to selective colleges. By the end of the program, each student will have written about a meaningful personal topic that is ready, or nearly ready, for submission with his or her college application.\nCollege Counseling: Even at the most prestigious private high schools the ratio of students to counselors can exceed 100:1, offering minimal individual contact and attention. College Admission Prep Camp gives each participant direct access to some of the top guidance counselors in the country. College counselors identify excellent colleges that are appropriate for each student\u2019s interests and academic background. In addition, the counselors teach students how to prepare their applications to match the expectations of college admission officers, including help with the finer points of style and phrasing. The program's counselors help students pinpoint top quality schools that are best suited to their particular needs and interests. Students leave at the end of camp with a list of potential schools that have been reviewed and discussed individually with a college counselor, advice from their counselor, and a college admission calendar that will help families avoid last minute scrambling and missed deadlines. Students also receive interview training that prepares students to present themselves in application or scholarship interviews.

Over the course of 14 days, students participate in a morning core course and choose from a variety of specialized afternoon electives. Students showcase their work in an extraordinary final performance, which includes monologue work and ensemble short scenes.\nAdmission Requirements Eligible students must be entering 9th-12th grade in order to attend the High School session of the California Actors Workshop. Students must demonstrate passion for acting and theater by having taken drama classes or planning to during high school. Students are required to submit a 250 word Personal Statement that explains their interest in acting and desire to attend the program.\nCore Curriculum The core curriculum for the Actors Workshop is an acting class that focuses on combining creative intuition with concrete technical skills. Following Stanislavski, students learn to tap into emotional truth while exploring how mental and physical techniques can nurture unconscious inspiration. Each morning, students will practice exercises that help them vocally project, physically tell stories, and emotionally and intellectually connect to characters. Both morning acting classes and afternoon rehearsals help students understand the basic building blocks of realistic acting such as playing objectives (what the character wants), obstacles (what stands in the way), and tactics (how the character tries to get around those obstacles to accomplish her objectives).\nElectives Elective offerings vary each year and depend on the specialty of the acting faculty. Possible offerings include:\nSolo Performance: Learn to research, write, direct, and perform a one-person show.\nMusical Theater: Some emotions and ideas can only be expressed in song. If you have dreams of Broadway, this elective can help you sing, dance, and learn the skills you need to explore the exciting world of musical theater.\nStand-up Comedy: If you\u2019ve always wanted to be in front of the microphone, here\u2019s your chance. Learn comic timing, observational humor, and how to interact with an audience when you\u2019re talking directly to them.\nThe World is a Stage Unlike other arts camps that are situated in isolated locations, the California Actors Workshop believes that one of the most important components of training for aspiring performers is to see as much professional theater as possible. For this reason, participants visit Bay Area theaters to observe hit shows and small productions. Recently attended productions include Jersey Boys, The Lion King, Rent, and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream at the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival. Students will often participate in a post-performance Q & A with actors and directors, during which they will have the opportunity to ask about techniques, artistic direction, and the life of an artist. In the classroom, instructors specifically draw on the material viewed at visited theaters. For the California Actors Workshop, the world is not only a stage but also a classroom.\n\u201cDrama-Free\u201d Recreation Even though the students and faculty live and breathe passion for the theater, the High School Actors Workshop students balance acting classes with daily \u201cdrama-free\u201d recreation. Students participate in a wide array of games, sports, and arts and crafts.

In this program we'll answer that question and many more as we explore the intriguing history of human-environment relationships, from ancient Rome to the present day.\nWe'll use art, literature, film, cartoons, music, maps, advertising, and other cultural objects in our quest to better understand nature and culture.\nThrough these lenses, we'll consider the diversity of environmental values, examine cultural manifestations of nature, and explore the role of society in forming natural resource and environmental policy.\nOur studies begin with Gilgamesh in ancient Mesopotamia and move on to Medieval game laws and tales of King Arthur's court. We will look at Romanticism in eighteenth-century Europe and America and see how nineteenth-century trends in landscape art led to nature protection and the creation of national parks in the United States. We will also see how the introduction of film and photography forever changed how we look at nature.\nWe'll then examine the rise of scientific ecology as an academic field and see how the science and the metaphors of ecology continue to affect how we think about nature and the environment today. Is nature more like an organism that can be harmed or destroyed, or is nature like a machine that can be altered, repaired, and fixed?\nFinally, you will see why our metaphors about nature matter when we introduce some \"pesky philosophical problems\" that continue to challenge environmentalists, such as: Do mountains exist? The answer to that question may surprise you.\nThe format of the program involves primarily readings and discussions, although along the way we may meet with guest speakers, view related films, and take occasional field trips to supplement what we learn in class.\n\"Nature and Culture\" is based in Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, ranked in national surveys as the best college of agriculture and related sciences in the country.", "price": "$ 6,020", "image_urls": ["http://www.meedow.com/static/images/programs/pi/a0bf0bb804b666ecf66e769bb04cc689.jpg"], "houseprice": " \n\t\t", "crimerate": "\n                201.60(US Average:309)\n\t\t", "latitute": "49.4371185303", "timecost": "2013-06-22 to 2013-07-13\n\nCost: $6020, housing and meals included, not covering the cost of books, supplies, or travel to the program.", "starton": "2014 enrollment starts soon.", "credit": "Has credit", "guide": "1.

There are two important reasons for this trend. First, these concurrent processors can potentially offer more effective use of chip space and power than traditional monolithic microprocessors for many demanding applications. Second, an increasing number of applications that traditionally used Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are now implemented with concurrent processors in order to improve functionality and reduce engineering cost. The real challenge is to develop applications software that effectively uses these concurrent processors to achieve efficiency and performance goals. The aim of this course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on experience in developing applications software for processors with massively parallel computing resources. In general, we refer to a processor as massively parallel if it has the ability to complete more than 64 arithmetic operations per clock cycle. Many commercial offerings from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel already offer such levels of concurrency. Effectively programming these processors will require in-depth knowledge about parallel programming principles, as well as the parallelism models, communication models, and resource limitations of these processors.

As actors, students will rely heavily on accessing their impulses, through which real responses and real behavior can be accessed in the moment. This technique is applied to improvisation with another person as well as the actor's way of finding things to do in rehearsal, interpreting a script, and creating the specific physical characteristics of each character the actor played.\nPlaywrights Workshop\nThe workshop for emerging playwrights is designed to create a supportive and stimulating environment for young writers to develop and share their writing.

This course introduces you to the concepts behind and applications of this crucial breakthrough.\nWe will review the basic physical principles that help us understand how stars work- gravity, pressure, radiations, and how radiation interacts with matter- and apply them to further our understanding of stellar structure. We will collect our own measurements of stellar properties, such as the masses, sizes and luminosities of stars, using robotic telescopes controlled via the internet and those at the University\u2019s Yerkes Observatory.
